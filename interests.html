            <h2>Gaming Preferences</h2>
            <p>Gaming has always been a part of my life, almost as much as reading.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE</strong> - These games changed everything for me. They built my way of seeing games and storys. UNDERTALE even had it's 10th Anniverary a couple days ago.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Horror RPGs</strong> - for some reason, game's like that are comforting to me. For Example: Project Kat and Paper Lily, I really love those.</li>
                <li><span class="horror-emphasis">NO CHEAP JUMPSCARES!</span> - I jump easily and honestly? It just pisses me off.</li>
                <li><strong>Top-Down RPG Style</strong> - There's something perfect about the classic overhead games that i really like a lot, like earthbound and rpgmaker games.</li>
                <li><strong>Indie Games</strong> - Indie games really give me the atmosphere that i like the most.</li>
            </ul>
